    "# Exploring Reformer the efficient transformer for text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most exciting developments on the deep learning for NLP over the past year was the publication of the [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) a paper by researchers at Google. This model solves one of the biggest bottle necks of the attention based models; the limitation on how many tokens can the model pay attention to. In the original BERT model the max lenght of a sentence was 512 (mention the computation cost of longer sequences). The researches propose as a solution using three differen mechanisms\n",
